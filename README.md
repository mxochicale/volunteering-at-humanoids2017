Volunteering at [Humanoids 2017 Conference](http://humanoids2017.loria.fr/) | [twitter](https://twitter.com/humanoids2017)

[This repository](https://github.com/mxochicale/volunteering-at-humanoids2017)
contains some descriptions of photos, videos and some work of some researchers at the days path as well as my personal experience as a volunteer.

In short, being volunteer at @humanoids2017 conference was a very enlightened experience,
because I was able to be present at the inspiring keynotes talks,
listen to many interesting talks, meet in person some of the big names in the
community of humanoids while selecting the right t-shirt size for them
and welcome pretty much all the assistances.

Description of the videos

I recorded this video with my mobile phone while I was volunteering at
@humanoids2017 conference [http://humanoids2017.loria.fr/ | https://twitter.com/humanoids2017]

Additionally,
you can find some descriptions of photos, videos and some references of the interesting work [1]
that is relevant in my research areas with regard to nonlinear time series analysis,
human-robot interaction, deep learning, and the quantification of skill-fullness.
